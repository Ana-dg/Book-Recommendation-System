This is a book recommendation system based on the userâ€™s ratings, age and location.
The system is a probabilistic collaborative filtering model that uses latent factorization. 
It uses MCMC sampling to estimate the parameters of the model, which captures the latent structure of user-item interactions. 

The project contains:
-data cleaning and preprocessing
-model training using the hierarchical poisson factorization with MCMC sampling
-hyperparameter tunning
-observation of the results of the model using the RMSE, MAE
-data visualization: tables and plots of the posterior distribution
