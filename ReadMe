This is a book recommendation system based on the userâ€™s ratings, age and location.
The system is a probabilistic collaborative filtering model that uses latent factorization. 
It uses MCMC sampling to estimate the parameters of the model, which captures the latent structure of user-item interactions. 
The project starts with data cleaning and preprocessing, and then continues with the model training using the hierarchical poisson factorization with MCMC sampling. 
After that we tune the hyperparameters and observe the results of the model using the RMSE, MAE, tables and plots of the posterior distribution.
